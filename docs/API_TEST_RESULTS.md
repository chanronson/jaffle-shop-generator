## Technical Implementation

### Schema Generation Methods
1. **Airbyte Import**: Automated schema generation from Airbyte connector manifests
2. **Manual YAML**: Custom schema creation with full control over data structure
3. **OpenAPI Import**: Direct import from OpenAPI specifications (demonstrated with Light.inc)

### Data Generation Features
- **Deterministic generation** with seed-based reproducibility
- **Unique constraint handling** with configurable retry limits
- **Relationship resolution** across multiple schemas
- **Business logic validation** with realistic constraints
- **Performance optimization** for large datasets

### Output Formats
- **CSV**: Standard comma-separated values for spreadsheet compatibility
- **JSON**: Structured data for API testing and web applications
- **DuckDB**: Analytical database format for data science workflows
- **Parquet**: Columnar storage for big data processing

## Next Steps

The Jaffle Shop Generator is now a **comprehensive synthetic data platform** capable of handling any API. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Additional API Connectors**: Salesforce, HubSpot, Shopify, etc.
2. **Advanced Relationships**: Many-to-many relationships and complex joins
3. **Time Series Data**: Historical data generation with trends and seasonality
4. **Data Quality Rules**: Advanced validation and business rule enforcement
5. **Performance Optimization**: Parallel generation and streaming output

## Getting Started

To use any of these API schemas:

1. **Choose your approach**:
   - Use existing schemas in `schemas/saas-templates/`
   - Import from Airbyte with `jafgen import-airbyte`
   - Create custom schemas following our examples

2. **Generate data**:
   ```bash
   jafgen generate schemas/saas-templates/plaid/ --output ./data
   ```

3. **Customize as needed**:
   - Adjust record counts
   - Modify constraints
   - Add relationships
   - Change output formats
